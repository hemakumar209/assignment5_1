1. If Z is norm (mean = 0, sd = 1)
Find P(Z > 2.64)
Find P(|Z| > 1.39)
    Ans:

      For P(Z > 2.64)
      > pnorm(q=2.64,mean=0,sd=1,lower.tail = F)
       [1] 0.004145301

      For P(|Z| > 1.39)
      >2* pnorm(q=1.39,mean=0,sd=1,lower.tail = F)
       [1] 0.1645289


2. Suppose p = the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of
California at Berkeley, and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has historically had a
40% acceptance rate for its graduate school. Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from
1973. Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the
officerâ..s claim, or do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less than 40%?
Use an Î± = 0.01 significance level.

                                                                  so conf level=1-significance level=0.99

          X-squared = 2.7747, df = 1, p-value = 0.09576
          alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.4
          99 percent confidence interval:

       p-value = 0.09576 which is greater than the significance level =0.01,                
                       we cannot reject the null hypothesis.


            they consistent with the  officerâ..s claim
